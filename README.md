# How-to-understand-github.
I am having a hard time trying to understand how Github functions. I am a beginner and barely about to make it through a basic JS course. 
As stated above, I am new to all this and everything has become so daunting after i came on Github and downloaded a recommended text editor. I would like to know how i can create
a space to practice problems (codes) and see if I get the answer i need as well as understanding how I am to find lessons or advice on this site? I also dont even know if anyone 
will see this. I don't even know what a repository is, the real life definition yeah, on github it seems to just be stored text? I followed the tutorial on the Github desktop and
I dont even know what the heck I did on that lol. I know im such a terrible noob, but i am going to dedicate my next decades of life to becoming a programmer and eventually a game developer.
Sadly my DA can't understand a lick of anything on this site. I am in the process of looking up YT videos, though some of you might understand my sentiments that I like to try and give it 
good ole' try yourself and try yourself again, again, again because it feels good as well as helps reinforce what you are learning as when I simply look up a video and have someone hold my 
hand through something I tend to not remember because there was no reinforcment, just someone saying "Do this and voila, golden." Though regardless of anything else, if this makes it to the
public. Could someone (Idk how notifications work, please stop laughing at me lol) try and let me know? Atleast I'll know that I got this out there and actually did something right. 
Thanks to anyone who sees this.
